            <p>The N Seoul Tower, located in Seoul (not surprisingly), was one of the highlights of my trip. In the early evening, our tour group arrived at the base of the tower. There, we found a beautiful park area with many visitors. This park area also had access to many convenience stores, restaurants, and gift shops. The key point of this park are the thousands of padlocks secured on the railings of the fence. Many people, especially couples, inscribe these padlocks with their names or other messages and secure them to the fencing. There were so many of various colors and shapes, and our group found padlocks inscribed with dozens of different languages!</p>
            <p>Following our time in the park, we took a gondola up to the actual base of the tower. After entering the tower, we took the high-speed elevator to the top of the tower. The tower also had shops and places to eat, similar to the park below. This tower is not necessarily incredibly tall (only around 800 feet), but it offers an incredible view of Seoul. Since our group came to the tower in the evening, by the time we reached the tower, a sunset was forming over the city. It was absolutely a major highlight of my South Korea trip.</p>

            <h3>Gyeongbokgung Palace</h3>
            <address class="author"><a rel="author" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carsonperz/">Carson Perz</a></address>
            <time datetime="2025-06-08" title="June 8, 2025">Jun 8, 2025</time>
            <p><img alt="A picture of Gyeongbokgung Palace, located in Seoul, South Korea" src="images/gyeongbokgung.jpg" width="400" height="350"></p>
            <p>The Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul is an incredible piece of history within such a rapidly modernizing city! Getting out of the taxi and stepping into the palace grounds was such a contrast in comparison to the highrises and LED screens we drove past to get there. In fact, while walking the palace grounds and feeling like you have been transported back into the mid-1000s, seeing tall buildings and towers surrounding the palace serve as the only reminder that you are currently in the present day!</p>
            <p>Built all the way back in 1395, it served as the first official royal palace built in the Joseon dynasty. However, during Japanese occupation, the palace was demolished. Since then, the South Korean government has launched a variety of restoration projects to bring Gyeongbokgung Palace back to what it was in the past.</p>
            <p>Within the palace grounds, we spent a lot of time walking around each of the gates, individual buildings, and bridges spanning over artificial ponds. The palace grounds also included the National Folk Museum of Korea as well as the National Palace Museum of Korea, both of which provided incredible insight into the lives of Koreans during the Joseon dynasty. The changing of the guards ceremony within the palace grounds was also an incredible experience! </p>
